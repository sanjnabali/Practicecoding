/*
Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, 
and replace the last element with -1.

After doing so, return the array.
âœ… Intuition Behind Optimal Right-to-Left Solution
Imagine standing at the last element and looking backward:

The last element has no right, so set it to -1.

For every element to the left, ask:

"What was the max value to the right of me?"

Keep a running tracker of the max so far (maxRight).

At each step:

Save current value to temp

Replace current with maxRight

Update maxRight = max(maxRight, temp)

int current = arr[i];   // save before overwriting
arr[i] = maxRight;      // use previously known max
maxRight = max(maxRight, current); // update max
Whenever you're asked to look at elements to the right, reverse traversal is a go-to pattern.

If you need to track max, min, sum, etc., consider using:

One pass + rolling variable

Stack or Deque if windowing is involved

Watch for edge elements (first/last) that may need special handling
