// This program calculates the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given number.
// It does this by counting the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n.
// The function `countTrailingZeros` iterates through multiples of 5 and sums up the counts of how many times each multiple divides into `n`.
// The main function prompts the user for input and displays the result.
// The output will be the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of the input number.
// For example, if the user inputs 5, the output will be "Number of trailing zeros in 5! is: 1" because 5! = 120, which has one trailing zero. If the user inputs 10, the output will be "Number of trailing zeros in 10! is: 2" because 10! = 3628800, which has two trailing zeros.
// the program uses a loop to count the number of trailing zeros efficiently without calculating the factorial directly, which is important for larger numbers where factorials grow very large very quickly.
// The program is efficient and works well for large inputs, as it only requires logarithmic time complexity relative to the input number due to the division by powers of 5.
// The program is simple and straightforward, making it easy to understand and modify if needed.
